##=## * Every quest should be unique (at least one field has to be different);
##=## * The "Name" field can't be very long;
##=## * The "Desc" field can be quite long;
##=## * The "NPC" field is JUST a name;
##=## * The "Sprite" field is the name of the sprite in "Graphics/Characters";
##=## * The "Location" field is JUST a name;
##=## * The "Color" field is a SYMBOL (starts with ':'). List under "pbColor";
##=## * The "Time" field can be a random string for it to be "?????" in-game;
##=## * The "Completed" field can be pre-set, but is normally only changed in-game

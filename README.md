# Kuray Infinite Fusion (KIF)

Kuray Infinite Fusion (KIF) is a fork of Infinite Fusion, which adds countless new features, including infinite colors for shinies, mods support (people can create mods and load them from a "Mods" folder), a powerful AI (thanks to DemICE), and more!

Kuray Infinite Fusion (KIF) is community-based and community-focused, it's made by the community, for the community, allowing anyone to easily create new features for Infinite Fusion and to have a better experience overall.

The original Pokemon Infinite Fusion (PIF) has been created by Chardub/Frogman, using Pokemon Essential.

Kuray Infinite Fusion (KIF) is standalone, which means, you do not need Pokemon Infinite Fusion (PIF), and you should NOT install KIF on top of a PIF game.

Please remember that the backbone of KIF (which is PIF) is still being developed and maintained by Chardub/Frogman, if PIF dies, KIF is very likely to die as well.

This Github allows you to see the game (open-source), but also to contribute to the development of this project with pull-requests, and download the latest release to stay up-to-date.
